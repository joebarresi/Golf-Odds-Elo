# Golf-Odds-Elo

At this current point, we are able to actually pull down odds. 

Biggest TODOs:
- Optimize/Refactor Weils code to be as efficent as possible
- start working on the fast API of Weil's code that will be called. 
- Start working on back-end node file that can: create scheduling of API calls and begin storing these odds into a dynamodb
- Begin work on a simple react file that will just call our python server
